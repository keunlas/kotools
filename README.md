# KoTools

The KoTools project contains code I wrote during my spare time. It includes self-made solutions, wrappers for open-source library C APIs, and some practical small tools for work.

The entire project uses CMake as the build tool, with code written in the C++20 standard, while the C APIs for open-source libraries are built using the C99 standard.
